Date: October 21, 2023

## Overview

This project uses a machine learning algorithm to cluster flight patterns. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of flight data, and then used to predict the cluster for each flight. The results can be used to identify flight patterns in a specific geographical region.

## Prerequisites

1. Git
1. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
1. VS Code Editor
1. VS Code Extension: Python (by Microsoft)

The following modules are required: 


| Module          | Version  |
|-----------------|----------|
| time            | 3.11.4   |
| collections     | 3.11.4   |


## Data Sources

The project utilizes live data from FlightAware, a leading provider of aviation data and flight tracking information, through PiAware 7.2 running on a Raspberry PI. The original data sources include various flight-related information such as aircraft identifiers, timestamps, altitude, latitude, longitude, speed, heading, and transponder codes.
